DUCKS has been tested using the following virtual machines and DOS emulators
(all running on Linux):


FreeDOS on VirtualBox
---------------------

    - The game runs flawlessly.  The mouse is too sensitive to movements for
      my taste, but this can be changed by adapting the mouse driver settings.


DOSEMU
------

    - The game runs flawlessly.  Using the default settings, animations are a
      bit jerky; to get smoother animations, increase the frequency of X
      refreshes by setting

        $_X_updfreq = (1)

      in ~/.dosemurc.


DOSBox
------

    - Animations are flickering or some parts of the screen are not properly
      drawn.  This is a problem with DOSBox's SuperVGA emulation, which does
      not properly support the particular video mode used by the game; there
      is nothing I can do about that.

    - On (very) old machines, the game can run too slowly.  You can try to
      increase DOSBox's frameskip setting by pressing CTRL-F8.
