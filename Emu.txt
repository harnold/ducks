DUCKS has been tested using the following virtual machines and DOS emulators
(all running on Linux):


DOSEMU
------

    - The game runs flawlessly.  Using the default settings, animations are
      a bit jerky; to get smoother animations, increase the frequency of X
      refreshes by setting

        $_X_updfreq = (1)

      in ~/.dosemurc.


FreeDOS on VirtualBox
---------------------

    - The game runs flawlessly.  The mouse is too sensitive to movements for
      my taste, but this can probably be changed by adapting the mouse driver
      settings.


DOSBox
------

    - Animations are flickering and some parts of the screen are not properly
      drawn.  This is a problem with DOSBox's SuperVGA emulation, which does
      not fully support the particular video mode used by the game.

    - On (very) old machines, the game can run too slowly.  You can try to
      increase DOSBox's frameskip setting by pressing CTRL-F8.
