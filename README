                                   DUCKS!


Introduction
------------

    DUCKS is a minimalistic remake of the game "Moorhuhn" aka. "Crazy
    Chicken", a game which, despite (or because of) its stupidity, was so
    popular in Germany in the late 1990s that it was jokingly accused of
    having a measurable negative impact on the national economy due to the
    numerous work hours wasted by employees playing the game.  This remake
    gives you the chance to counter productivity once again...


How to play
-----------

    Your task in this game is simple: shoot as many flying ducks as you
    can in 90 seconds.  You earn points for each duck that you hit.  Of
    course, hitting a quick duck yields more points than hitting a slow
    one.  Your current score is displayed in the top-right corner of the
    screen.  The number in the top-left corner is your remaining time.

    Controls: Aim with your mouse, shoot by pressing the left mouse
    button.  To cancel the game before your time expires, press the
    'Esc' key.


System requirements
-------------------

    DUCKS runs under DOS and Windows 9x.  It requires an SVGA card with
    at least 1MB of video memory that can display 800x600 pixels at 256
    colors and that supports VBE 2.0.

    If you have a more recent system, you can try to run the game in a
    virtual machine using FreeDOS or use a DOS emulator such as DOSBox
    or DOSEMU.
